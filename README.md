# CS104BashOrganizer
This project was made as a part of the final project of our First year DIC Course: CS104:Software Systems Lab. The File Organizer is a bash script designed to help you organize your files by moving them into categorized folders based on their file extensions. It simplifies the task of managing and organizing a large number of files by automating the process.
This repository includes the problem statement , my source code and a documentation providing the usage of the file.
